# Slay the Spire Additions

Cards, relics, and maybe more!

These are random ideas that I've implemented. Usually directly or adapted from community ideas on [Slay the Spire Reddit Page](www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire), sometimes my own.

## Cards

### Ironclad

- Multicast (Power): Gives 1 (2) chances to play skill cards an extra time with a 40% chance.

### Silent

- Reckless Speed (Power): Gain 1 energy at the start of your turn. When an attack is played, lose 1 strength for the remainder of the turn. [Credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/1n2l1s4/its_my_first_time_making_my_own_custom_card_hows/)
